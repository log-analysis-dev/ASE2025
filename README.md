# Empirical Evaluation of Log Analysis Techniques in Heterogeneous Modern Systems

The detection of software logarithmic anomalies plays a critical role in ensuring the reliability and security of modern software systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in log parsing and the potential of advanced techniques for anomaly detection; however, existing research remains constrained by several key limitations: continued reliance on outdated benchmark datasets, limited investigation into lightweight LLMs, and inconsistent evaluation protocols that hinder fair comparisons across models. To address these challenges, this study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of log parsing and anomaly detection methods. We construct six new datasets that represent both modern large-scale and low-resource logging environments, and evaluate eight lightweight open-source LLM-based parsers across these datasets. In addition, we apply a unified training protocol and shared labeled subsets to assess five state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, ensuring consistency and fairness in evaluation. Our experimental results yield several important insights. First, parsing performance varies significantly across datasets, with models struggling to generalize in structurally diverse or resource-constrained environments. Few-shot prompting consistently improves accuracy, particularly for logs with high variability. Second, while anomaly detection models perform well on structured datasets, they face substantial challenges in capturing subtle or context-specific anomalies in more complex scenarios. Our findings highlight the importance of dataset diversity and identify critical log characteristics—such as entry length and dynamic variable frequency—that significantly influence both parsing and detection outcomes. This study offers practical insights to help researchers and practitioners develop robust, efficient, and generalizable log analysis frameworks suitable for real-world deployment.
